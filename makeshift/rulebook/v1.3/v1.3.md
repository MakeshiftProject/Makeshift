# Ahoy there!
Welcome to the v1.3 rulebook!

Welcome to a new era of Makeshift! This rulebook explains everything you need to know from new changes to existing rules!

# What's New?
There are many new changes to v1.3!

v1.3's codename is, **"The Rework Update"**!

* Reworked Traits -- You can finally use traits using your player stats! There are many different and new stats! You can find these traits [here](https://github.com/MakeshiftProject/Makeshift/tree/main/makeshift/global_data/traits.txt)!

* New Conditions and Limits / Reworked Stats -- When tuning your stats to your needs, there are multiple conditions and limits to what you can do! They are explained [here](https://github.com/MakeshiftProject/Makeshift/tree/main/makeshift/global_data/conditions.txt)

* Ranked & Unranked -- Ranked Movesets are manually verified and approved movesets for fairness, whereas there are unranked movesets which do not need to be verified & approved! This system is being used to prepare for FIRS and to remove weight on Gamemasters and beginners. Beginners can now make movesets without being penalised for unfairness!

* Practice Matches (since v1.2.5) -- You can now practice against a Gamemaster and fight against an existing moveset or a training dummy!

## Are there any bug fixes / moveset nerfs/buffs and etc.?

They can all be found [here](https://github.com/MakeshiftProject/Makeshift/tree/main/makeshift/moveset_log/)! This folder contains a changelog of all nerfs and buffs to ranked movesets!

## Anything planned?

We're planning to add:

* Global Buffs -- We're currently planning to implement this on v1.4! The concept of Global Buffs is to buff every user in ongoing matches and not single-time matches! This can vary from a x2 damage boost to a passive healing buff!

* Fully Implemented Ranking System (FIRS) -- This is planned for v1.4-v1.5! We are soon going to have a leaderboard for registered ranked players to compete on for a little competition spirit!

* FIRS Season System -- The player with the most round wins per season (season lasts 1 month) wins and gets 1 [Season Coin]!

* Preparation Items -- While preparing for the match, use a preparation item which lasts early game which might boost your chance of winning early!

# What is Makeshift and how does it work?
Makeshift is a turn-based RPG game inspired by D&D and Yu-gi-oh. The game is completely customisable, with the only thing holding you back is your imagination and the EX shop.

# Movesets

## Types of Movesets
There are many types of movesets in Makeshift. These are:

* Player-made Movesets -- Movesets created by users! This is the most common and recommended moveset type, for late-game players and beginners.

* EX Movesets -- Exclusive movesets bought from the Exclusive Shop. From the exclusive shop, you can buy movesets with Level Coins and Level Fragments. More informations in the Exclusive Shop.

* Season Movesets -- Mostly bought with Season Coins. More information on the current season's MD file.

## Moveset Ranking
There are 2 systems for movesets, RANKED and UNRANKED.

#### **RANKED**
- **Verified and approved for fair play** (for a fair match and more fun)
- Able to compete in RANKED matches and compete in Seasons (for a little competition spirit!)
- Season buffs are applied (to help you in matches)
- Exclusive Shop is open (for you to buy exclusive items)
- Your own account file (to track your currency and owned movesets)
- Requires a gamemaster to supervise
> This is recommended for beginners to late-game players. You are automatically approved to be a RANKED moveset once you've been verified and approved for fair play.

#### **UNRANKED**
- No restrictions (also means no fair play)
- No limitations (only your imagination)
- Your match, your rules (get to do whatever you want with your moveset)
> This is recommended for beginners, and really creative people who don't care about fair play. This is not good in the long term though.

## Moveset Requirements
For a moveset, you are required to fill in many holes, such as:

* Your stats -- They define your traits and conditions, as well as how good your attacks are and how much damage is reduced from you.

* Normal Moves -- Moves that are common and require nothing to use. Max of 3 and can be used in other movesets, even ones that are not your own.

* Reserve / Unique Moves -- Moves that are locked until a certain requirement is met, such as reaching a certain turn. There is no limit for unique/reserve moves unless you make the certain requirement the same, which has a limit of 5 moves.

### Move Stats
There are only 3 stats (1 is being deprecated in v1.3.5), which are the following:

* ATK -- This is a stat that helps with your ATTACK moves. It is a general stat, meaning it's a multi-purpose stat and not always just for attacking.

* DEF -- This is strategically and normally used only for damage reduction or if your moveset relies on it (like Dark Knight in Season 1).

* DODGE (deprecated in v1.3.5) -- The chance of dodging an enemy move with a DODGE move. This is normally used just for conditions and to raise the percentage for DODGE moves.
