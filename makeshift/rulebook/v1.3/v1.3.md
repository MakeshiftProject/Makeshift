# Ahoy there!
Welcome to the v1.3 rulebook!

Welcome to a new era of Makeshift! This rulebook explains everything you need to know from new changes to existing rules!

# What's New?
There are many new changes to v1.3!

v1.3's codename is, **"The Rework Update"**!

* Reworked Traits -- You can finally use traits using your player stats! There are many different and new stats! You can find these traits [here](https://github.com/MakeshiftProject/Makeshift/tree/main/makeshift/global_data/traits.txt)!

* New Conditions and Limits / Reworked Stats -- When tuning your stats to your needs, there are multiple conditions and limits to what you can do! They are explained [here](https://github.com/MakeshiftProject/Makeshift/tree/main/makeshift/global_data/conditions.txt)

* Ranked & Unranked -- Ranked Movesets are manually verified and approved movesets for fairness, whereas there are unranked movesets which do not need to be verified & approved!

## Are there any bug fixes / moveset nerfs/buffs and etc.?

They can all be found [here](https://github.com/MakeshiftProject/Makeshift/tree/main/makeshift/moveset_log/)! This folder contains a changelog of all nerfs and buffs to ranked movesets!

## Anything planned?

We're planning to add:

* Global Buffs -- We're currently planning to implement this on v1.4! The concept of Global Buffs is to buff every user in ongoing matches and not single-time matches! This can vary from a x2 damage boost to a passive healing buff!

* Fully Implemented Ranking System (FIRS) -- This is planned for v1.4-v1.5! We are soon going to have a leaderboard for registered ranked players to compete on for a little competition spirit! The player with the most round wins per season (season lasts 1 month) wins and gets 1 [Season Coin]!
