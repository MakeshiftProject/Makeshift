# Season 1 Shop
Welcome to the Season 1 Shop!

## What do I use for the shop?
Every Season, you earn 2 **Season Fragments** per match you participate in plus another 5 Season Fragments every match you win!

With Season Fragments, you can buy special Season-only movesets which last for only a limited-time as ranked before they are unranked.

But, Season Fragments are not all, you can gain **Season Coins** which give you access to permanent ranked movesets and you can use it to flex on people as well. The only way to get Season Coins is through winning the most matches out of the entire season, which you gain 2 Season Coins.

### Do I have to participate to gain this currency?
Players get a 5 Season Fragment payout every Sunday 9:00pm UTC+10. The only way to gather Season Coins is through competing in the Season Leaderboard.

## Are the only things we can buy at the shop movesets?
Currently, yes. However, we are planning to add more exciting things to the shop, such as badges and discord roles for all you discord members out there!
